# Author Statistics

CodeScene provides an aggregated view of all author contributions.

## Detailed Author Statistics

The author information is intended as quick summary over the contribution activity
in a codebase:

![An example of detailed author statistics](guides/social/author-statistics.png)

The key metrics are:

* **Primary Component Owner**: In how many architectural components is this developer the primary author?
* **Primary File Owner**: In how many modules/files is this developer the primary author?
* **Commit Pattern**: Is this a frequent contributor or someone that only occasionally commits code? The definitions are:
  * *sparse*: at least one commit per 14 days.
  * *regular* at least weekly commits
  * *frequent* commits multiple days per week.
* **Former Contributor**: When checked, then this is a developer whoâ€™s no longer part of the team.
