### Welcome to the CodeScene documentation!

This documentation is divided into sections, each being suited for different
types of information you might be looking for.

## New Users

  discovered CodeScene. You will learn how to sign up, what CodeScene does, and
  how you run your first analysis.

  metrics.

## From Code to Delivery: meet the 4-factors of successful software

* [From Code to Delivery: the 4 factors model](4f-dashboard/4-factors-dashboard.md) introduces the 4 factors essential to

  Pull Requests to serve as an automated code review and quality gate.

* [CodeScene ACE: Auto-Refactor Code](auto-refactor/README.md) is CodeScene’s innovative Generative AI solution which allows you to automatically fix code smells. Integrates with your IDE as well as the [CodeScene CLI tool](cli/index.md).
